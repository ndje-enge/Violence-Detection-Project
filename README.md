# Optical Flow Project

This project implements and demonstrates optical flow algorithms, including the Lucas-Kanade method, to detect violence in video sequences. The code is compatible with Google Colab for easy experimentation and visualization.

## Features

- Detection of good features to track using corner detection.
- Implementation of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm.
- Visualization of motion vectors on video frames.
- Output video generation with optical flow overlays.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `Optical_flow_Enge.html` file in your browser or run the code cells in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to process your own videos or use the provided examples.
